## Kaggle Contests for Private Use

Kaggle does offer in-class, however seems a bit restricted and people may be hesitant uploading data.

Why this project:

 * Organize machine learning projects
 * Promote healthy competition among friends/coworkers
 * Track progress and enforce champion/challenger model in production
 * Invite potential collaborators/employees to demonstrate their skills
 * Allow different methods of testing (eg daily prediction)
